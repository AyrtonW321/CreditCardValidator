Some things that need fixing:
- onload there is an option to make or not make before they even see the input screen
- dropdowns are aligned upright
- dropdown logic instead of alerts
- fix up the randomness for the bank generation
- logic for banks + card type (i.e td only visa
- smoother transiton for card and/or click to spin instead
- make the css for the site even better
- make input box look better
